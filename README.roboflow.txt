The following pre-processing was applied to each image:

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Randomly crop between 0 and 5 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -5 and +5 degrees
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -18 and +18 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 0.5 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 0.58 percent of pixels
